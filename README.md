# About me ðŸ¤“


**Davor-vm/Davor-vm** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving my software arquitecture knowledge and my JS skills
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the fundamentals of software, JavaScript and Backend development
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on big, small and medium proyects, my main goal is to learn how to be the best software engineer and not collapse in the proccess.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with the things that begginers don't see like:
  - what should be my main focus?
  - what should I do to improve?
  - where should I start?
  - is it dumb to learn this?
  - is it even dumber not to learn that?
  you know, like a baby having his first steps.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, if I know the answer, I will help
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love Dr. Pepper
